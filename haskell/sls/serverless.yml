  sls-func:
    handler: sls.sls
    # Here, mypackage is the Haskell package name and myfunc is the executable
    # name as defined in the Cabal file. The handler field may be prefixed
    # with a path of the form `dir1/.../dirn`, relative to `serverless.yml`,
    # which points to the location where the Haskell package `mypackage` is
    # defined. This prefix is not needed when the Stack project is defined at
    # the same level as `serverless.yml`.
