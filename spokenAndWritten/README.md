# Spoken and written language

I believe that spoken/written language is too linear. I intend to use it in a way that is more dimensional and expandable, like a programming language.

This shall involve the removal of ambiguity whilst still keeping conciseness (concision?)

Brackets suggest that a particular point can be expanded upon - they are like a lambda and the alternative to this is a footnote - the equivalent of a regular function.

Every function has a context, and so does every sentence. Every sentence is encapsulated in some kind of context, be it language, voice, speaker, implications, previous sentences or words, etc.

A way of structuring a sentence was defined in terms of its word relations, and helps link associated words to the right words.

The classic XYTITYUO sentence:

Violinist linked to crash blossoms

expands to:


Violinist (n. subj.) <- (linked to) -> crash (n. sub-obj)
^
|
v
blossoms (intr. v.)

We're already getting there, because we have a two dimensional relationship set.

We can see that the violinist is linked to a non-specific crash, and also that the violinist blossoms - rather than the wrong version:

Violinist (n. subj.) <- (linked to) -> crash (adj.?) <- ?uncertain relationship? -> blossoms (n. pl.)

Let's use language as an understood construct to perhaps pull out into another dimension in another way, perhaps more readable, and split to the verb:

One-dimensional cruise liners don't exist like they used to.

Perhaps a little like this.

Phrase-for-phrase:

One-dimensional
    cruise liners
        don't exist
            like
        they used to.


Word-for-word:

                        One
                    dimensional

                    cruise

                liners
                    do
                        n't
                exist

                        like
                    they
                            used
                        to.

One may be easier for note taking, or they may be separated like this for clarity.

An advantage of this is that they can work with any language using categories.
