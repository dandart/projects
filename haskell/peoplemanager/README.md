# People Manager

## Premise

You know those football manager games? It's like that, only cooler, and with people.

It's like the Sims games only with stats and less moving and such

I'm envisioning it be like:

[ NEW ]

So then you may maintain, create or delete relationships and get various upgrades, boosts or whatnot depending on these.

You can maintain, and actions have consequences, unless you've actively trained and tried to prevent them.

You can move countries and things, use a selection of currencies... obviously here we used the Dobbscoin but it won't be the only choice.

It will be able to automatically generate a list of people given either no one or the first person you meet

You can change names e.g. by deed poll or moving

It'll give you an audit trail of what you've done in your life.

New people might be 18 and start with Â£1500, just to get things going a bit.

You can manage monthly outgoings and incomings, or you could just not... and die. Or you could let it deal with it for you.

You manage calendars too, and your relationship status will change with people depending on how much you meet and manage these.

E.g. you arrange a park meetup, but if you ditch, you lose relationship points (under the hood, I guess) unless you call to cancel?

Random events like "Went out for a nice meal", "Got invited to the ball game", "Got hit at the biker gang meetup by a fellow biker gang member but it was alright, it was an accident, no hard feelings."

But then if you "no hard feelings" people too much, you could get mentally ill, or you could erroneously mistrust people and they could walk all over you.

Then these calendars would be a choice too, not forcing you to have a real one.

You could even manage your own government in time. I liked those government / country management things. Maybe this will be citizens of a country. Maybe several countries.

Hmm.
